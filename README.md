A chrome extension that quickly skips through advertisements.

In the future I may publish the extension but for now please:

$ git clone git@github.com:Alperdec/yt-adblock.git
```
- Open Google Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions`
- Enable `Developer Mode` (it should be in the top right corner)
- In the top left select `Load unpacked extension`
- Navigate to the downloaded repository and select the extension folder
